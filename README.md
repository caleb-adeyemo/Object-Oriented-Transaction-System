# Object-Oriented-Transaction-System
The aim of this assignment is to facilitate the development of Java and object orientated programming skills by designing and implementing a program to simulate the operaton of a fictonal catering company, using classes, objects, instance variables and instance methods. This project will also develop skills in UML class diagrams, file I/O, inheritance, exceptons and basic enumerative types in Java. Further general learning outcomes include: describing abstract systems using technical diagrams; following specifications when developing software; documenting code to enhance readability and reuse; increased experience of programming in Java; increased awareness of the importance of algorithm complexity; and using inheritance to model relationships between classes.
